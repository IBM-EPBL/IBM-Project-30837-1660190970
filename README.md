# _*Personal Expense Tracker*_

# _Project Description_

There are various applications that provide solutions to manage personal and group expenses but not many of them provide a comprehensive view of both cases. In this paper, we develop a web application that keeps record of a user's personal expenses, his/her contribution in group expenditure. The proposed application would eliminate messy sticky notes, spreadsheets confusion and data handling inconsistency problems while offering the best overview of your expenses. With our application we can manage their expenses and decide on their budget more effectively.
